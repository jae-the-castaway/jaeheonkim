I'm a web developer who is passionate about creating simple minimalistic user-friendly websites. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, nodeJS. I'm curretly focusing on building projects for that is accesible for everyone. My personal interest is in walkable cities, minimalism, filmmaking, running.

I had worked for Republic of Korea Air Force as a Master Sergeant for 7 years, but always yearned for more. Becoming a husband to a beatiful wife made me grow a big heart, and pushed me to challenge myself, resulting in my switching over to the tech industry.

I have a passion for creating accessible and user-friendly websites. My process starts with a thorough understanding of the project requirements, target audience, and business objectives. Then, I create a wireframe and mockup that outlines the site's structure, layout, and user flow. and then, I use my coding skills to bring the site to life, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies as needed.
