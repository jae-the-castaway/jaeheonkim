# Jae-heon Kim Portfolio and Blog

This is a personal website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is based on Next App directory with [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#server-components) and uses [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to manage markdown content.
